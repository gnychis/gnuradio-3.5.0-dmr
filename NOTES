- basically, what I've done in UHD transmitter is changed the number of inputs from 1 to 2, to include not just the complex sample stream but also a trigger
- now, trying to find the right place to generate this trigger
- need to understand what connects to uhd_transmitter:
  * in tunnel.py self.sink is uhd_transmitter, and it connects transmit_path() to it (self.txpath)
- so then backtrack it to transmit_path, expand its number of outputs
  * expanded its number of outputs
- then, in ofdm.py and the hire block "ofdm_mod" â€¦ I think this is where the trigger needs to be generated
  * expand its outputs to 2 also
